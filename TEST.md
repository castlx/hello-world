# This is just a test.
Testing testing if something changes without saving ctrl+s
I think it did't work. So whenever you edit something on the code lines #let me just call it code lines since idk the correct terms yet xD#
So ctrl+s -ing now xD
Let me try to use parenthesis in this.
I just notice when doing the git commit -m, defining long strings or message isn't what I expected to be displayed on GitHub.
Testing (will it work? xD)

So now, it seems using () here seems to be just typing a normal(#for now#) text and is displaying what it should be on the preview on GitHub(repositories).
(Please don't mind me I'm just talking to myself xD, still i don't know how to Shift+Enter though xD some other time, kapoy google haha)
I apologize if I made this like a diary but, wcyd? xD bye for now.

I just noticed. YOU JUST PUT A BLANK LINE TO SHIFT+ENTER. Silly me. lmao
