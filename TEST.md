# This is just a test.
Testing testing if something changes without saving ctrl+s
I think it did't work. So whenever you edit something on the code lines #let me just call it code lines since idk the correct terms yet xD#
So ctrl+s -ing now xD
Let me try to use parenthesis in this.
I just notice when doing the git commit -m, defining long strings or message isn't what I expected to be displayed on GitHub.
Testing (will it work? xD)
